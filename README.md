# rainycrack
Generates words by tacking, the bruteforce entropy is reduced by two and spans from the two sides.  
Treats all the lengths together.  
!Only works with even length character sets!

You should consider rainycrack for what it is: a medium for studying word mangling.
Note that I removed the 'rain' algorithm because I cannot find a way to set the initial values for multithreading,
For serious work please use my fork of JohnTheRipper featuring the 'rain' alonside the 'tacking' methodology.
